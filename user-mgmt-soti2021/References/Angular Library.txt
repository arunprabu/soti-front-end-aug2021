Create Angular Library
---
Create Workspace. 
  ng new my-big-app --create-application=false 

The above cmd will not create app. Instead it will create workspace.
It's an empty project. 


Creating library is a 3 step process
Step 1:
Let's create a Library

Step 2:
And  Let's create An Angular App 

Step 3: 
Make use of the library in an angular app 
=====

Let's now create a Library 
------
  ng g library my-weather-lib --prefix=mwl

  As of Angular 11, 'projects' folder would be created and inside that you can see the library.

  Let's have quick file walk thru. 

  Check the my-weather-lib's package.json 

  And the package.json of my-big-app and tsconfig.json also.

  Library has been created. Let's now look at create an angular app. 


Let''s create an Angular App
-------
  ng g application weather-app-demo 

  This app will not have package.json. 
  but all other things are as same as any default ng app

  Now, let's start the server of the angular app. 
  ng s weather-app-demo 

  The app will run in localhost:4200

Now, Let's make use of the library
-------
  If we want to use the library within angular app, we have to build the library.

  ng build my-weather-lib --prod 
  Don't forget --prod in the above command if you are working on angular 9+. 

  Look at the dist folder's location, it is outside the 'projects' folder.

  now, you can import the library into app.module of angular app

  And use the selector of library in your component.

  thats it...

  if you are modifying your library.. don't forget to build the library again.
  Note: if your library has http calls, you need to import 'HttpClientModule' in library's module.
  And If you do binding, *ngIf, *ngFor kinds of stuff, you need to import 'CommonModule' in library's module.

You can also create a tar archive file
TAR Archive file compressed using Gnu Zip (gzip) for the library

cd dist/my-weather-lib 
npm pack
After this is over, you can install the package using npm install cmd
cd .. 
cd ..
npm install ./dist/my-weather-lib/my-weather-lib-0.0.1.tgz

Then, find the above package inside node_modules folder 
Finally, don't forget to remove the entry is main tsconfig.json (workspace level file)

Restart your app and then check it.
